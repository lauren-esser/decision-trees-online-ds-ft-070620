It shares internal decision-making logic, which is not available in the black box type of algorithms such as Neural Network. Its training time is faster compared to the neural network algorithm. The decision tree is a non-parametric method, which does not depend upon probability distribution assumptions. Decision trees can handle high dimensional data with good accuracy."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["#### Pros\n", "- Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize.\n", "- It can easily capture non-linear patterns.\n", "- It requires little data preprocessing from the user, for example, there is no need to normalize columns.\n", "- It can be used for feature engineering such as predicting missing values, suitable for variable selection.\n", "- The decision tree has no assumptions about distribution because of the non-parametric nature of the algorithm."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["#### Cons\n", "- Sensitive to noisy data. It can overfit noisy data.\n", "- The small variation (or variance) in data can result in the different decision tree. This can be reduced by bagging and boosting algorithms.\n", "- Decision trees are biased with imbalanced datasets, so it is recommended that you balance out the dataset before creating the decision tree."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## 6. Appendix: Grid Search\n", "\n", "Because there are multiple techniques for pruning a decision tree, each with their own impacts on bias vs. variance, you'll often want to use a grid search to find the best combination of parameters.
